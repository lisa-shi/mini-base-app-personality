Your app is live at https://mini-base-app-personality.vercel.app/, but it's showing the old template. Let's fix it!

## üöÄ Fix Steps (5 minutes)

NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME=Crypto Personality Quiz
```

6. **IMPORTANT:** For each variable, select **"Production"**, **"Preview"**, and **"Development"**
7. Click **"Save"** for each

### Step 2: Push Your New Code

git status

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "Add Crypto Personality Quiz with wallet integration"

# Push to GitHub (this triggers Vercel deployment)
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Wait for deployment to complete (1-2 minutes)
4. Look for "‚úì Ready" status
